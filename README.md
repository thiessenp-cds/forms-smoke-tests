# forms-smoke-tests

Temporary space to explore smoke tests.

## Running Them

Run `yarn cypress` open the tests and run it. *Manually clicking the "submit" button* and the fail screen should show. 

TODO: There seems to be an issue with the form timer or similar stopping the automated button click.
